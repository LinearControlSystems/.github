# Linear Control Systems
Welcome to the Linear Control Systems course organization! This repository contains all the necessary resources, materials, and assignments for the course. Here, you'll find everything you need to succeed in your studies and projects related to control systems.

## Course Outline
This course, part of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology, focuses on linear control systems during the Fall 2024 semester.
The focus of this organization is on learning MATLAB/Simulink applications in linear control systems, especially in the areas of control system analysis and design. Through practical exercises and projects, students will gain hands-on experience with tools used to model, analyze, and design control systems.

### Key Topics:
* Open-loop and closed-loop control systems
* Mathematical modeling (transfer functions and state-space representation)
* Stability analysis and feedback control
* Controller design (PID controllers, lead-lag compensators)
* Real-world applications in industries like automotive, robotics, and aerospace

## Content Layout
Each repository is divided into the following sections:

* **Lecture Notes & Resources:** Contains all the lecture materials, slides, and supplementary resources about MATLAB/Simulink.

* **Assignments/Simulations:** Weekly assignments designed to reinforce core concepts. Each assignment covers a specific aspect of MATLAB/Simulink application in control systems.

* **Projects:** Collaborative projects where students apply the learned concepts to design and implement control systems, often using MATLAB/Simulink or similar tools.

* **Reference Materials:** A collection of additional books, papers, and technical documentation for students who want to explore beyond the course material.

## Assignments & Grading
The course includes weekly assignments that are crucial to understanding the material. These assignments will involve both theoretical problems and practical applications, using tools like MATLAB/Simulink.

* **Assignments/Simulations:** Assigned weekly and evaluated to ensure a deep understanding of the material.
* **Projects:** projects contributing significantly to your final grade.
Assignments and projects will be major components of the final grade, emphasizing the importance of hands-on learning.
